//! Core abstractions of the Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency (RTIC) Monotonic timers, used
//! internally for scheduling and users can use them for time.
//!
//! You can write generic *libraries* and HALs using the `Monotonic` trait in this crate. If you
//! want to write application code then you'll need an *implementation* of the RTIC framework for a
//! particular architecture. Currently, there are implementations for these architectures and OSes:
