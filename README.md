# `rtic-monotonic` for RTIC v1

> Core abstractions of the Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency (RTIC) Monotonic timers

# [Documentation](https://docs.rs/rtic-monotonic)

This crate contains the trait and will need an actual implementation to be useful.

## For RTIC v2 see [rtic-time](https://github.com/rtic-rs/rtic/tree/master/rtic-time) instead
